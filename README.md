# We Plan - Google Calendar Meets the Rest of Social Media
Hey there! My name is Jimmy Zheng and this is the repo for my Final Project for my bootcamp as Awesome Inc U.
<br><br>
I am still working hard to fulfill the vision I have for the project. I would love any advice you may have!
Using packages such as FullCalendar and Axios with React and Laravel frameworks, this app aims to improve user experience, by limiting the amount of distracting notifications from many group chats, for socialites who engage in many social networks.
